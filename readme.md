# AF_NETLINK 

This is experimenal linux netlink socket,

see [https://origin.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/netlink/](https://origin.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/netlink/)

linux uses netlink to communicate to kernel for various operation, such ethtool, nf_tables,
iproute2, and some various subsystems.

I create this to learn how that software works under the hood.

# TL;DR

THE ethnetlink will be same as iproute2, and ethtool
